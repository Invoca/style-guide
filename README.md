## Making Changes

This guide exists to represent the collective knowledge and agreed upon standards of Invoca's Engineering department. Changes are welcome and encouraged from all sources! Contributors should try, and may be required, to provide background information and/or reasoning behind their proposed change.

Changes do not, and should not, be expected to be retroactively applied to existing, merged code.

These contents are not expected to be requirements for code to pass review, but rather a reference of the collective understanding for writing clean, maintainable, and understandable code. With that said, ignoring these helpful hints and tools may require exceptional cases.
